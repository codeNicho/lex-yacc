using variable names 1 character long...lowercase or uppercase
1. a = 1 + 100;
2. display a; 

we can now use 'a' in other expressions since it was declared and set to a value

3. B = a - 10;
4. print B; 
5. print a + B;

exit; // exits the program
The programming accomodates for multiplication and division as well
